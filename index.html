            <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.

                <h1> Jimmy Dean Sausage  </h1>
                <p>Dean founded the Jimmy Dean Sausage brand of breakfast sausage, which was originally called "Pure Pork Sausage." The Jimmy Dean Sausage company did well, in part due to Dean's own extemporized, good-humored commercials.Dean sold the company to the Sara Lee Corporation in 1984 for $80 million. He remained involved as the company spokesman after the takeover, though Sara Lee, under the leadership of John Bryan, immediately began phasing him out of management duties. By 2002, he was no longer acting as spokesman. In 2018, after Bryan's death, the company resumed an advertising campaign featuring Dean.</p>
